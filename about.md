### About Me

Hola! My name is Blanca Miller and I am a graduate student in computer science at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research focus is in applications of machine learning for robotics. This means that I apply predictive solutions for robots in the wild. Specifically, I am using reinforcement learning on a autonomous ground vehicle. I am also interested in developing robust machine learnign techniques through integration of causal inference (see Judea Pearl, 2018 arxiv [https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04016]).


### My life

I am a non-traditional student. My first couple of degrees were in secondary education in math. I went on to be a math teacher and then decided to go back to school for engineering. My engineering background is mechanical and computer science. I am finishing my masters in computer science this May 2018(!) then moving forward with my PhD in computer science.
