### **Reinforcement Learning for an Autonomous Ground Vehicle Controller**

I am developing a controller using tried and true control theory, while also taking advantage of current deep learning methodology. My hope is to produce a high-accuracy optimal controller for a [self-driving Lincoln MKZ](https://youtu.be/SEw0hXr5uoE), as reliable and accurate systems remain an open-problem for autonomous systems. This is part of a larger project under my university's [Intelligent Mobility](https://www.unr.edu/ncar/about-us/im) project. 

### **Multi-GPU Controller using** [**NVIDIA's PX2**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-px/)

Due to autonomous vehicle hardware being very new and not well understood in practice, I am determining software structure efficiency to optimally use on-board computing resources. Vehicle's are equipped with lots of sensors, e.g. multiple cameras and lidar. This requires a balance of computational resources so that no one aspect of the system hoards the computational power and potentially causes a bottle-neck that dilutes accuracy and safety.   


### **Causal Inference for Machine Learning Decision-making Logic**

This is a newly evolving interest. Existing machine learning methods are unable to communicate decision-making logic. For my dissertation, I am interested in exploring how causal inference might help equip learning systems with intelligent analysis. This idea stems from a recently published [Judea Pearl (2018) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04016).
