  Because computing and its subfields, e.g. machine learning, significantly influences how each of us does life, I believe it's critical to stay informed on how these spaces evolve (or how they need to evolve). Some of these topics are directly related to my research, others not so much, but generally I seem to form an opinion. Given that, I've created a blog to share and provide evidence for some of these thoughts. My aim is to perhaps contribute a slightly different perspective that drives discussion.
