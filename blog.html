  Because computing and its subfields significantly influence how each of us does life, it's critical to stay informed and consider how these spaces evolve or how they need to evolve. Given that, I've created a blog to share and provide evidence for some of my thoughts on computing topics. My aim is to contribute a perspective that drives discussion.
