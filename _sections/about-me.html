    Hola! My name is Blanca Miller (far left in image above) and I am a graduate student of computer science and engineeering at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research focus is in applications of machine learning for robotics. This means that I apply predictive solutions for robots in the wild. Specifically, I am using reinforcement learning on a autonomous ground vehicle, a Lincoln MKZ (see image above). I am also interested in developing robust machine learning techniques through integration of causal inference.

    I have been a research assistant since 2016. Since the Fall of 2018 I have been working on a multi-disciplinary team of engineers for my university's project, <a href="https://www.unr.edu/ncar/about-us/im">Inteligent Mobility</a>. Our lab's research is led by <a href="http://richardkelley.io/about">Dr. Richard Kelley</a>. My academic track was initially in secondary education in math (B.S. 2013) and equity and diversity (M.S. 2016). While working on my first masters, I was a high school math teacher and decided to go back to school for engineering. I have an engineering background in mechanical engineering (minor 2016) and computer science (M.S. 2018). I am finishing my masters in computer science this May, then moving on to my PhD in computer science!
